# RankStars
_A social platform for sharing reviews, building lists, and connecting people._

**RankStars** is a web application that allows users to create and share reviews about anything they love! Users can also build custom lists, follow other users, and engage with a community of shared interests.

üëâ The app is deployed on Render and you can try it [here](https://rankstars-backend.onrender.com/).

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with:
